# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure that is comprised of non-contiguous nodes. Each node consists of a data element that stores data and a reference pointing to the next node via a link. The first and last nodes of the linked list are commonly referred to as 'Head' and 'Tail, respectively. The picture below shows a linked list with 5 nodes.
