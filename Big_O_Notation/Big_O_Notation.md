# Big O Notation

Big O notation is a mathematical tool widley used to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms. Below is the list of functions commonly used to classify this complexity.

The following graph demonstrates the rate of the complexity growth as *n* increases unboundedly.

It is desired to develop alforithms with xomplexity of *O(1)*, *O(log2 n)*, and *O(n)*.
